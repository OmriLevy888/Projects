# Paint
Double click the PaintProgramme.bat to run the programme (it will open DosBox and set everything up), you may need to install DosBox first. A help page with information about everything is found once the programme is laoded, just press on the question mark and you will be taken to the help menu to choose the category you need help with.

# Tetris 3D
Double click the Tetris3D.exe to run the game. The game is made with the Unity engine. I was too lazy to implement a tutorial / help page so here we go - use WASD to move the pieces and the arrow keys to rotate the pieces (all relative to the camera's current position). Use Q and E to rotate the camera around the platform and hold the space key to get an arial view of the platform. Press the shift key to move the piece by one level and tap the tab key to move the piece down as much as possible (sorry about the music in advance, it's my first and last attempt at creating any music :P).
